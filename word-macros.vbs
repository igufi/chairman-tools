' CHAIRMAN'S TOOLBAR macro collection
'
' (last updated: 2020-09-20)
'
' This is the macro collection for the Chairman's Toolbar
' It was created by Jan Ignatius (Nokia Bell Labs), with help from Jan KÃ¥ll (Nokia)
' These macros were used to help the chair and vice chair of the IFA working group in ETSI ISG NFV standardization org.
' The macros assume that the agenda document contains tables of submitted contributions, the exact layout is critical:
'
'               | UID | Title | Allocation | Source | Abstract| Status | Notes |
'
' NOTE: No other tables with exactly 7 columns should be used in the agenda, otherwise some of the macros will fail.
'
' The supported workflow is as follows:
' - separate excel macro was used to wrangle the .xls file from portal.etsi.org to match the above layout.
' - each contribution starts with an empty status, with white/no-color background
' - contributions can be either approved, (feat)agreed, almost feat agreed, revised, noted, postponed, withdrawn or given a temporary
'   flag of "return"
' - the TODO-tool assumes we want the agenda to only contain contributions with a status of approved, noted, withdrawn or postponed
'   and highlights all contributions that do not match those states
' - the linking tool is useful when approving agreed documents - if a link exists then the file is available.
'
' There are some leftover macros that are not visible in the toolbar, e.g. "email approval" and "further discussion required"
' The file linking macro uses the windows username to quickly populate the correct folder for contributions, for others it will ask
' the user to point it to the right directory.
'
' Known bugs:
' - the unlinking macro is buggy, haven't figured out why some of the links in the UID column are not cleared away.
' - the tabulation of the pop-up window and printed statistics is not always neatly lined up.
' - there is not nearly enough error catching in the macros, e.g. the statistics tools get really unhappy if you have other tables
'   with 7 rows that don't conform to the layout listed above.
'
' TODO:
' - combine "agreed", "almost feat agreed" and "agreed megaCR" functions - there's a lot of copy&pasting done currently between them
' - optimize the TODO-tool as it now iterates all cells, we could just concentrate on the 6th cell of a row
' - LinkFiles and todo-tool has some copy&pasted code between them, we could clean this up
